title: How I created HPC Cluster with LXC on my laptop
---

In this post I will talk about, rapid deployment of MPI Cluster on Linux Container in Ubuntu 12.04. It allows the cluster administrator to focus on the core cluster tasks,rather than spending time on installing linux cluster. It removes the complexity of the cluster installation and expansion process.


This script is useful for basic development and testing â€“ if all you want is to test 
some HPC code than you can check it by running this script which rapidly deploys HPC Cluster.
Virtual HPC cluster is deployed with Linux Container(LXC) and libvirt.

`Quickly Run HPC cluster with LXC on your laptop`

Note:
If you want to know [Why LXC for running HPC](/why_lxc_for_hpc) 

##Prerequisites
In this tutorial, we will be using LXC for creating filesystem of container and libvirt API(virsh) for managing those containers.
Install them with:

`apt-get install lxc`

`apt-get install libvirt-bin`

##What we wiil do ?

We will be creating one master node and then 3 worker nodes to actually do the work.
Everthing will be installed automatically by script.

- Master Node:
  - Hostname : master
  - IP : 10.0.0.1

- Compute Node 1:
  - Hostname : compute1
  - IP : 10.0.0.10

- Compute Node 2:
  - Hostname : compute2
  - IP : 10.0.0.11

- Compute Node 3:
  - Hostname : compute3
  - IP : 10.0.0.12


##Filesystems for master and compute node

As mentioned in my previous blog [Build HPC cluster from scratch with LXC](/Build HPC cluster from scratch with LXC) ,I have created HPC Cluster with LXC manually. Just download those Ready-made filesystems for [master node](/mpi-master-fs) and [compute node](/mpi-compute-fs). Extract both of them in `/var/cache/lxc`.

Just check by typing:

`ls /var/cache/lxc` 

Master node filesystem path is `/var/cache/lxc/mpi-master/rootfs`

Compute node filesystem path `/var/cache/lxc/mpi-worker/rootfs`

Pre-configured master node filesystem has:

- `cluster` user: to operate our cluster.
- NFS Server: to share cluster user's home directory with all compute nodes.
Just check it by doing:

`cat /var/cache/lxc/mpi-master/rootfs/etc/exports` 

it will look like this:

`/home/cluster *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)`

- Passwordless SSH: cluster user will do password less SSH login in all compute node.
- MPI (`mpich2`): Cluster will communicate with MPI.


Once MPI cluster is installed, Filesystem will be in `/var/lib/lxc/$master_node/rootfs`


##LXC Template for master and compute node

Typically, all LXC templates are stored in /usr/lib/lxc/templates.I have modified basic ubuntu template for creating two different templates. Just download [master node template](/mpi-master-template) and [compute node template](mpi-worker-template).

When we create containers with lxc-create, we are specifying template name and container name like:

`lxc-create -t ubuntu -n demo`

Same here for creating master node container `mpi-master` will be used:

`lxc-create -t mpi-master -n master`

For creating compute-node container `mpi-worker` will be used:

`lxc-create -t mpi-worker -n compute1`

Now, filesystem of master and compute node is created in `/var/lib/lxc`.

##virsh

Now we will manage our container with virsh. In libvirt, every VM's configuration is defined in xml file. Download this sample [`base.xml`](/base_xml) file.



`virsh -c lxc:/// define $master_name.xml`

`virsh -c lxc:/// start $master_name`

`virsh -c lxc:/// list --all`

`ip=$(tail -n15 $path/var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.eth0.leases | grep fixed-address | cut -d" " -f4 | cut -d";" -f1)`




`sed -i "s/master/$master_name/" $path/etc/fstab`

##Summary

If you are working with HPC, having a full blown HPC Cluster on your laptop is awesome :)
