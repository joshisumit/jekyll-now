##Projects
###1) Reconfigurable Cloud

Platform Used: `Linux, Shell Scripting, LXC, cgroup`

Reconfigurable cloud aims at running Cloud and HPC applications on the same infrastructure in a way that preserves the consolidation capabilities of commodity clouds. It improves HPC application performance by running them in LXC (Linux Containers).Moreover it aims at optimal utilization of IT infrastructure.


###2) Easy Wordpress

Platform used: `Linux, Shell Script`

[Easy Wordpress](https://github.com/joshisumit/easy_wordpress) is a shell script that easily creates wordpress hosting environment. It rapidly installs wordpress on Ubuntu, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.


###3) Rapid HPC

Platform used: `Linux, LXC, libvirt, Shell Script`


[Rapid HPC](https://github.com/joshisumit/rapid-hpc) is a shell script that rapidly creates HPC cluster using LXC on your laptop.
