##Publications

**Sumit R. Joshi**,  Vineeta Tiwari, Manish Kumar Abhishek, *“Reconfigurable Cloud: Consolidating HPC and Commodity Applications in the Cloud”*,  Vol. 4-Issue 5(May-2015),  International Journal of Science, Engineering and Technology 
Research (IJSETR), ISSN- 2278 – 7798 , www.ijsetr.org

##Projects
###1) Reconfigurable Cloud

####Platform Used: `Linux, Shell Scripting, LXC, cgroup`

Cloud computing is emerging as an additional deployment option for some of the HPC 
applications. But still, it currently does not come without 
drawbacks for application performance. These performance 
issues take place due to resource contention, where one VM is 
able to impact the performance of another. This interference 
directly creates impact on performance and scalability of HPC 
application. Additionally, virtualization overhead is also a 
barrier for adoption of cloud for HPC application. 

Reconfigurable Cloud, is able to accommodate commodity 
application and HPC application on the same hardware. It 
solves the above issues by isolating HPC workload from other 
users and by giving near native performance for running HPC 
applications. With reconfigurable approach, same web-
oriented cloud infrastructure can also be reused for HPC as 
well.

###2) Easy Wordpress
####Platform used: `Linux, Shell Script`

[Easy Wordpress](https://github.com/joshisumit/easy_wordpress) is a shell script that easily creates wordpress hosting environment. It rapidly installs wordpress on Ubuntu, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.


###3) Rapid HPC
####Platform used: `Linux, LXC, libvirt, Shell Script`


[Rapid HPC](https://github.com/joshisumit/rapid-hpc) is a shell script that rapidly creates HPC cluster using LXC on your laptop.
